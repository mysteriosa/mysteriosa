# Why GitHub sucks

GitHub, the world's largest software forge with many amazing features hosts the majority of open source projects.  
Why is this a problem?  
Not just because it's proprietary and owned by Microsoft, no. It's about control.  
You may have noticed I don't particularly like Github. Why do I keep using it then? Because I have no choice.  
The projects I'd like to use and contribute to are hosted here, so there's no way around.

I used to have another GitHub Account, which I was actively using, but now that I changed my nick I thought it might be a good opportunity to get rid of it and migrate to something better.
Which I did, but I quickly realized I still need GitHub so here we go :o

## How to fix it and why federation is great

There are self-hostable alternatives to GitHub, such as [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) or GitLab.
But putting your code onn your own instance and having contributors sign up on it first is _really_ inconvenient.  
That's why some clever folks started working on federation, which is a concept you might already know from e-mail:  

All Servers can run independently, but they all speak the same protocol. This enables us (the open source community) to do very cool stuff with it.  
If you would like to, for example contribute to a project hosted on [my instance](https://git.mysteriosa.net),
you can just create a Merge Request using your account hosted on the instance of your choice (for example <https://codeberg.org>).  
GitLab announced plans to support federation too, so you could in theory even contribute via GitLab, even though I'm using an entirely different software stack (Forgejo).

## Moving Forward

Help loosening GitHub's grip on the open source community by migrating your projects to a software forge which puts you, the user, in control.
Forgejo is awesome and imo even better than GitHub feature-wise. If you can't / don't want to self-host it, there are many public instances available, such as [codeberg](https://codeberg.org).  
If you contribute to other projects and the maintainers are open to discussions, you might wanna try bringing up the idea of migrating.  
**Important:** Please stay respectful! If someone doesn't want to migrate, that's their decision. Unfortunatetly there are lots of legitimate reasons to host a project on GitHub.

If we are lucky there will be legislation prohibiting this gatekeeping behavior of Big Tech and GitHub will be forced to federate. (Or they might even do it voluntarily, lets see)

With all that being said, thanks for reading my little rant, thanks for contributing to open source projects!

Have a nice day!

P.S. FUCK YOU MICROSOFT! At least let me sign-up via tor :'(
